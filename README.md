# Project 2

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain the main program (not to be submitted to Web-CAT)
- `submit`: the folder with the project code, to be submitted to Web-CAT

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
